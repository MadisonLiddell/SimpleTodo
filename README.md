# SimpleTodo
An Android application that functions as a very simple to-do list.

It was created for an assignment in CEN4411 Advanced Mobile Application Development at Rasmussen College. It is object oriented and has just a few features so far but will most likely be expanded in my free time. 

What it can do so far:
* Saves state with a parcelable bundle
* Task information saved and retrieved from SQLite database so that it persists between sessions.
* Today's Tasks button that shows only tasks ending on current date
